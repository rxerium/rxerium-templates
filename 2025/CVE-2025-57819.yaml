  name: CVE-2025-57819 - Sangoma FreePBX Authentication Bypass and SQL Injection RCE
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Sangoma FreePBX versions 15, 16, and 17 contain a critical authentication bypass vulnerability due to insufficiently sanitized user-supplied data. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to access the FreePBX Administrator control panel (ACP) and perform arbitrary database manipulation leading to remote code execution. This zero-day vulnerability has been actively exploited since August 21, 2025, targeting systems with ACP exposed to the public internet and inadequate IP filtering. CISA added this to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue on August 29, 2025, with a remediation deadline of September 19, 2025. Patched in endpoint versions 15.0.66, 16.0.89, and 17.0.3.
