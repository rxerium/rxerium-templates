  severity: critical
  description: |
    Oracle E-Business Suite Concurrent Processing (BI Publisher Integration) versions 12.2.3-12.2.14 contains a critical path traversal vulnerability that chains multiple flaws to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild by the Cl0p ransomware gang since August 9, 2025. Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code without authentication over the network. CISA added this to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue on October 6, 2025. Oracle published an emergency security alert and patch on October 4, 2025. The October 2023 Critical Patch Update is a prerequisite for applying this security update.
