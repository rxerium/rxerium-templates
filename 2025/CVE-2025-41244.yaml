info:
  name: CVE-2025-41244 - VMware Aria Operations and Tools Privilege Escalation
  author: rxerium
  severity: high
  description: |
    VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability resulting from untrusted search paths. The service discovery feature can be abused by unprivileged users through staging of malicious binaries that are subsequently elevated for version discovery. A malicious local actor with non-administrative privileges on a VM with VMware Tools installed and managed by Aria Operations with SDMP enabled can exploit this to escalate privileges to root. This zero-day vulnerability has been actively exploited since mid-October 2024, attributed to UNC5174, a suspected China-sponsored group. CISA added it to the KEV catalogue with a remediation deadline of November 20, 2025.
