info:
  name: CVE-2025-8876 - N-able N-central Command Injection Code Execution
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    N-able N-central remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform versions prior to 2025.3.1 contain a critical command injection vulnerability that allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary operating system or application commands. The flaw results from improper sanitization of user input, enabling attackers to inject malicious commands that execute unexpectedly. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild targeting managed service provider (MSP) environments. CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue on August 13, 2025. While authentication is required, successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise. Patched in version 2025.3.1 released on August 14, 2025.
