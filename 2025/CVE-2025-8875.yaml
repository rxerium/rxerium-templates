  name: CVE-2025-8875 - N-able N-central Insecure Deserialization Code Execution
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    N-able N-central remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform versions prior to 2025.3.1 contain a critical insecure deserialization vulnerability that enables authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. The flaw stems from improper handling of untrusted data during deserialization, allowing malicious actors to craft objects that execute commands when processed. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild targeting MSP environments. CISA added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue on August 13, 2025. While authentication is required, successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise. Patched in version 2025.3.1 released on August 14, 2025.
