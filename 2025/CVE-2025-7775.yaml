  name: CVE-2025-7775 - Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway Memory Corruption RCE
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway contain a critical memory corruption vulnerability affecting instances configured as a gateway, AAA virtual server, or with CR virtual server type HDX, as well as those bound with IPv6 services or service groups. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this improper memory handling flaw to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day by sophisticated threat actors in targeted intrusions against public and private sector enterprises to deliver webshells providing backdoor access. CISA added it to the KEV catalogue on August 26, 2025, with an unusually urgent two-day remediation deadline (August 28). Patched in NetScaler ADC and Gateway 14.1-47.48 and later releases.
