  name: CVE-2025-10035 - Fortra GoAnywhere MFT Critical Deserialization Remote Code Execution
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Fortra GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer versions prior to 7.8.4 and sustain releases prior to 7.6.3 contain a critical deserialization vulnerability in the License Servlet Admin Console. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to deserialize arbitrary actor-controlled objects through validly forged license response signatures, leading to command injection and remote code execution. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild by Storm-1175 threat group deploying Medusa ransomware. With a CVSS score of 10.0, this represents maximum severity requiring immediate patching.
