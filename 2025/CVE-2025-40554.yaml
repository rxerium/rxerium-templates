  name: CVE-2025-40554 - SolarWinds Web Help Desk Authentication Bypass
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    SolarWinds Web Help Desk version 12.8.8 Hotfix 1 and prior contains a critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-1390: Weak Authentication) that allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute actions or methods on a target system which are intended to be gated by authentication. With a CVSS score of 9.8, this vulnerability can be exploited over the network with low complexity, requires no privileges, and has high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Based upon the vendor supplied CVSS scores, the impact is equivalent to the RCE deserialization vulnerabilities, likely meaning it can also be leveraged for remote code execution. This vulnerability was discovered by watchTowr's Piotr Bazydlo and disclosed on January 28, 2026. Customers are advised to update to Web Help Desk version 2026.1 on an urgent basis outside of normal patching cycles.
