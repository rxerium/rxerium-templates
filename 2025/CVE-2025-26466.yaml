id: CVE-2025-26466

info:
  name: CVE-2025-26466 - OpenSSH Pre-Authentication Denial of Service
  author: rxerium
  severity: medium
  description: |
    OpenSSH client and server versions 9.5p1 through 9.9p1 contain a pre-authentication denial of service vulnerability. For each ping packet received, the SSH server allocates a pong packet in a memory buffer and stores it in a queue, which is only freed after the server/client key exchange completes. Malicious clients can continuously send ping packets causing uncontrolled memory consumption on the server, leading to denial of service. The vulnerability requires high attack complexity and affects approximately 3.5 million internet-facing OpenSSH instances. Patched in OpenSSH 9.9p2.
