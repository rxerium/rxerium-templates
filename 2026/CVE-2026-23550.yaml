info:
  name: >
    Modular Connector <= 2.5.1 - Privilege Escalation
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Modular Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266) in versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate their privileges and gain administrative access to the affected WordPress site. The flaw arises from insufficient permission checks within the plugin, enabling attackers to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This could lead to full system compromise, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of site content, and potential installation of malicious code. This vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild since January 13, 2026.
