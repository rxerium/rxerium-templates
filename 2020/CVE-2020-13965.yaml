  name: CVE-2020-13965 - Roundcube Webmail Cross-Site Scripting
  author: rxerium
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Roundcube Webmail versions before 1.3.12 and 1.4.x before 1.4.5 contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because text/xml is among the allowed types for preview, allowing XSS via a malicious XML attachment. This vulnerability was added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation by Russian threat actors. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking and credential theft.
