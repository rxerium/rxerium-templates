info:
  name: CVE-2024-32444 - RealHomes WordPress Theme Privilege Escalation
  author: rxerium
  severity: critical
  description: |
    InspiryThemes RealHomes WordPress theme through version 4.3.6 is affected by a critical privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper assignment of user permissions. The theme allows users to register new accounts via the inspiry_ajax_register function but fails to properly check authorization or implement nonce validation. If registration is enabled, attackers can arbitrarily specify their role as "Administrator" in a specially crafted HTTP request, gaining full control of the WordPress site including content manipulation, script injection, and access to sensitive data. Over 32,000 websites are at risk.
